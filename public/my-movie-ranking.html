<h1>The Top Three Christopher Nolan Movies</h1>

<h2>My personal list of Christopher Nolan's best movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p> Is there even a question anymore? From the music, to the cinematography to the acting, everything about this film is exemplery</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p> Controversial choice, but I think this is comes in second, not only because of the awesome performance of a stellar cast, 
    but also because of how well this movie was made and how it amazingly it delivers its message
</p>

<h3>The Batman Trilogy</h3>
<p> Yes, this is cheating, because there are technically three movies, with The Dark Knight being the best one, however from the 
    narrative perspective, we can view all three films on a continuum, showing a whole story over three movies. If we look at it like
    that, these iconic movies are what put Nolan on the front page, and what can I say about everyrhing from the action, the music, to
    the acting? Just spectacular.
